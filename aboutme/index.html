    <h2>Josue Ronaldo Aguilar Palma</h2>
    <p>Hello Class! I am Josue Ronaldo Aguilar, and I am from Santa Ana, El Salvador. At this moment,
    I am heading down to get my bachelor's degree in applied technology, hoping that 2026 is my graduation
    year. I love to play the piano, spend time with my wife, and sometimes I play video games. I have been
    married for almost 11 months a year and we are excited to celebrate our first anniversary.<p>
    
    <p>I currently work for an IT company providing support to end users with their computer issues, but
    I would like in future to get something more in the back end, like in network, programming, and why not,
    web programming. I have been a member of the church for about 12 years, and at this moment I have a
    calling as a first counselor of the bishop</p>
